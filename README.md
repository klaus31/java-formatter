# java-formatter

Format Source Code written in Java.

## Yet another code formatter!

Needs:
* Code formatting independent from IDE, Editors etc.
* Not configurable but implementable to whatever needs you have
* Not only formatting but code changing (if you want to)<br>
  E.g. kill all inline documentation or @author or @Override
* Priceless

## How to implement a formatter

Check out project, let CodeActionDeciderSimpleFactory return your own implementation and compile

## What it is not (yet)

* Ready to use!
* A Tool formatting you good looking code from Character Chaos. (However, it is up to you writing a good pre-processing method).
